# Session 5
At the end of this session you'll learn **OOP in Js**
## OUTCOMES
**Upon the compilation of this session you'll be able to :**
- Understand classical object oriented programming (Abstraction - Encapsulation - inheritance - polymorphism)   
- OOP in Js
- Constructor functions and the new operator
- prototypes
- Prototypal inheritance and the prototype chain.
## TASKS
- Read those two articles
    1. [Blog](https://akozdev.github.io/)
    2. [Article](https://www.thecodeship.com/web-development/methods-within-constructor-vs-prototype-in-javascript/)
- Solve this challenge :
1. Use a constructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make and a speed property. The speed property is the current speed of the car in km/h;
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console;
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console;
4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.

DATA CAR 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
DATA CAR 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

GOOD LUCK
